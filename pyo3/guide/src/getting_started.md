# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of building a simple Python extension called `TODO`.

## Install Rust

Before we begin, we need to install Rust using the [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) installer:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

If you already have rustup installed, run this command to ensure you have the latest version of Rust:

```bash
rustup update
```
